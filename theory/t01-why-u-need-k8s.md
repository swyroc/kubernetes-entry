# Container & Container Orchestration

## Differences between Container and Container Orchestration

### Notice:
* Container is the result of the application been packaged.<br>
* Container & Container Orchestration are the logical concept.
* Containers have helped simplify & standardize how software is modularized & deployed.
* Applications are broken up into various discrete services that packaged in container.
* The number of container and the number of application (service) are not always equal. One application could have more than one container via scaling.
* The communication between the containers of the same application is the issue. 
* Container orchestration has arisen to help equally simplify & standardize how these containers come together to make usable software system.

**Docker** is the **tool** to package the application to **build out a container**. Docker is not the container.
<br>
If you have ten containers and four applications, itâ€™s not that difficult to manage the deployment and maintenance of your containers. If, on the other hand, you have 1,000 containers and 400 services, management gets much more complicated. 

It is not difficult to create a container for application, but when you want to scale the application from one container to multiple containers, many issues might show themselves for the scalablity. From above we realize that: **We need a tool to help us with scaling the existing multiple containers**.

Kubernates is the tool to help with container management - automating the deployment, management, scaling, networking and availability of multiple containers.
Kubernates is the container orchestration tool.

Before, all the goods are shipped by a boat and goods are loose and are not well organized. The unit of shipping goods is the box. After the goods are shipped to the land, worker needs to sort each goods box and classify them according to each goods box's belongling.

And now look at the modern shipment:<br>

Now the goods are shipped by using container. Goods are placed into container and goods are well organized. There is a mechanism to manage all the containers. By managing containers the goods are also well managed. This is called container orchestration. If one container cannot afford the shipment of the goods then worker could add another container to solve the problem.

## What is Container Orchestration
Container orchestration is all about managing the lifecycles of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. Software teams use container orchestration to control and automate many tasks:

* Provisioning and deployment of containers
* Redundancy and availability of containers
* Scaling up or removing containers to spread application load evenly across host infrastructure
* Movement of containers from one host to another if there is a shortage of resources in a host, or if a host dies
* Allocation of resources between containers
* External exposure of services running in a container with the outside world
* Load balancing of service discovery between containers
* Health monitoring of containers and hosts
* Configuration of an application in relation to the containers running it


# High-level Architecture Design

If container orchestration tool wants to do the high-level management, then from the top there should have many instructions to define something.

* There should has a configuration file tells tool the detail of the container management.
* The configuration file lists all the necessary factors that tool needs to do the control and management.
* The control and managment should be related with the real activities.
* There should has a way for the tool to control and manage the lifecycle of the container in the host.
